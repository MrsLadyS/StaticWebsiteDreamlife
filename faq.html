                <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
                <div class="section-callout">
                    <h4>Who is Dreamlife-Sim designed for?</h4>
                    <p>Financial institutions such as credit unions, banks, and brokerages that run community financial education programs and want ongoing engagement for members ages 18–40.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="section-callout">
                    <h4>What problem does this solve after workshops or classes end?</h4>
                    <p>It keeps momentum going by turning education into ongoing, goal-based action so members continue progress between events instead of stalling. It also reaches adults who can't or don't have time for in-person events—Dreamlife-Sim brings your resources and connection to them when they need it, so you engage people who would otherwise stay out of reach.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="section-callout">
                    <h4>Is Dreamlife-Sim a course or an app?</h4>
                    <p>It’s a self-guided digital app experience designed to be used before, during, and after education moments.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="section-callout">
                    <h4>How does Dreamlife-Sim integrate with programs we already run?</h4>
                    <p>Dreamlife-Sim is designed to extend your existing education efforts into a digital experience without adding staff or complexity. A demo will clarify the best integration approach for your program.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="section-callout">
                    <h4>What does pricing look like?</h4>
                    <p>Pricing is based on licensing plus a per-user cost. Request a demo to discuss partner packages and get exact pricing.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="section-callout">
                    <h4>What do members actually do inside the experience?</h4>
                    <p>Members visualize goals, map pathways, and take weekly micro-actions that keep progress moving over time.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="section-callout">
                    <h4>How do we measure engagement or outcomes?</h4>
                    <p>Dreamlife-Sim provides aggregated engagement insights—participation trends, return visits, and signals of what members are working toward (e.g., homebuying, saving for college)—so you can report on impact beyond one-time post-workshop surveys and demonstrate program value without surveying every member.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="section-callout">
                    <h4>We have a small team and limited capacity. How does Dreamlife-Sim fit?</h4>
                    <p>Dreamlife-Sim is built to extend your existing events without adding staff, extra workshops, or dedicated logistics. The app runs alongside what you already do; members get ongoing engagement between events, and you get insights without running more programs.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="section-callout">
                    <h4>What is the best next step if we’re interested?</h4>
                    <p>Schedule a demo. You’ll see the experience, review partner options, and discuss how Dreamlife-Sim fits your existing education strategy.</p>
