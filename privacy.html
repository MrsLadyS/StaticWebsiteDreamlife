                        Institution-Managed Use: Where an institution issues access codes for classroom use, the
                        school/instructor is responsible for ensuring students use anonymous, non-identifiable

                    <li>
                        Compliance Allocation: The institution is responsible for obtaining any required parental
                        consents and for COPPA/FERPA compliance. Moneyling acts as a service provider/processor to
                        the institution under the separate agreement
                    </li>

                    <li>Long-Horizon Modeling: Moneyling permits long-horizon modeling (e.g., compounding to 80 years) for planning; this does not create a child account</li>
